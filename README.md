ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, my name is Reid. Thanks for checking out my Github.
Here you will find some of my personal coding projects. I recently started my Github (April 2021),
so I am still working on uploading past work and creating new projects to share! Most of my 
coding projects are short and sweet. I like dabbling with a new framework/tool, and then moving
onto the next. 

ðŸ‘€ My hobbies/interests include
  - Software and Programming
  - Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
  - Studying Languages (HSK 2+ Mandarin Chinese)
  - Online PC Gaming
  
ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me @ reid11programmer@yahoo.com or reid.witt@raytheon.com
